# Prompt for Custom Front end From Scratch

You and your team have been contacted by a local, elusive, client. They have a new product and they need a responsive website built for them in order to market it online; they know you’ve got just the right skill set to craft their vision. Secretive as they are, they have decided to NOT give you details about their company, nor give you details on the product they are selling. Instead, they hand over to you a simple sentence, which they want you to interpret, in order to build the best possible responsive website for them to use as a marketing tool. The sentence they give you is:

> “Waves”

# Description
### This project was given as a partner project. Given the prompt "waves", as a two person team, we came up with the idea of a psuedo-surf shop. This project was done with vanilla JS and HTML/CSS. As well as all designs are custom and completely new.
